|----------------|---------------|
| I |  |
| Je,Christine, qui ay plouré | I, Christine, who have wept for eleven years in a walled |
| XI ans en abbaye close, | abbey where I have lived ever since Charles (how strange |
| Où j’ay tousjours puis demouré | this is!) the King’s son – dare I say it? – fled in haste |
| Que Charles (c’est estrange chose!), | from Paris, I who have lived enclosed there on account of |
| Le filz du roy, se dire l’ose, | the treachery, now, for the first time, begin to laugh; |
| S’en fouy de Paris de tire, |  |
| Par la traïson là enclose, |  |
| Ore à prime me prens à rire; |  |
| II |  |
| A rire bonement de joie | I begin to laugh heartily for joy at the departure of the |
| Me prens pour le temps yvernage | wintry season, during which I was wont to live confined to |
| Qui se depart, où je souloie | a dreary cage. But now I shall change my language from |
| Me tenir tristement en cage. | one of tears to one of song, because I have found the |
| Mais or changeray mon langage | good season once again … well endured my share. |
| De pleur en chant, quant recouvré |  |
| Ay bon temps |  |
| Bien ma part avoir enduré. |  |
| III |  |
| L’an mil CCCCXXIX | In 1429 the sun began to shine again. It brings back the |
| Reprint à luire li soleil. | good, new season which had not really been seen for a |
| Il ramene le bon temps neuf | long time–and because of that many people had lived |
| Qu’on [n’] avoit veü de droit oil | out their lives in sorrow; I myself am one of them. But I |
| Puis long temps, dont plusers en dueil | no longer grieve over anything, now that I can see what I |
| Orent vesqu; j’en suis de ceulx. | desire. |
| Mais plus de rien je ne me dueil, |  |
| Quant ores voy ce que [je] veulx. |  |
| IV |  |
| Si est bien le vers retourné | But since the time when I came to stay where I am the |
| De grant dueil en joie nouvelle | situation has completely changed, great sorrow has given |
| Depuis le temps qu’ay sejourné | way to new joy and, thanks be to God, the lovely season |
| Là où je suis, et la tresbelle | called Spring, which I have longed for and in which every |
| Saison, que printemps on appelle, | creature/thing is renewed, has brought greenness out of |
| La Dieu mercy, qu’ay desirée, | barren winter |
| Où toute rien se renouvelle, |  |
| S’est du sec au vert temps tirée. |  |
| V |  |
| C’est que le degeté enfant | The reason is that the rejected child of the rightful King |
| Du roy de France legitime, | of France, who has long suffered many a great misfortune |
| Qui long temps a esté souffrant | and who now approaches, rose up as if towards prime, |
| Mains grans ennuiz, qui or aprime, | coming as a crowned King in might and majesty, wearing |
| Se lieva ainsi que vers prime, | spurs of gold. |
| Venant comme roy coronné |  |
| En puissance tresgrande et fine, |  |
| Et d’espérons d’or espronné. |  |
| VI |  |
| Or faisons feste à nostre roy! | Now let us greet out King! Welcome to him on his return! |
| Que tresbien soit-il revenu! | Overjoyed at the sight of his noble array, let us all, |
| Resjoïz de son noble arroy, | both great and small, step forward to greet him joyously – |
| Alons trestous, grant et menu, | and let no one hold back – praising God, who has kept |
| Au devant — nul ne soit tenu! – | him safe, and shouting ‘Noël!’ in a loud voice. |
| Menant joie le saluer, |  |
| Louant Dieu, qui l’a maintenu, |  |
| Criant “Noël!” en hault huer. |  |
| VII |  |
| Mais or vueil raconter comment | But now I wish to relate how God, to whom I pray for |
| Dieu a tout ce fait de sa grace, | guidance lest I omit anything, accomplished all this |
| A qui je pri qu’avisement | through His grace. May it be told everywhere, for it is |
| Me doint, que rien je n’y trespasse. | worthy of being remembered, and may it be written down – |
| Raconté soit en toute place, | no matter whom it may displease – in many a chronicle |
| Car ce est digne de mémoire, | and history-book! |
| Et escript, à qui que desplace, |  |
| En mainte cronique et hystoire! |  |
| VIII |  |
| Oyez par tout l’univers monde | Now hear, throughout the whole world, of sornething which |
| Chose sur toute merveillable! | is more wonderful than anything else! See if God, in |
| Notez se Dieu, en qui habonde | whom all grace abounds, does not in the end support |
| Toute grace, est point secourable | what is right. This is a fact worthy of note, given the |
| Au droit en fin. C’est fait notable, | matter in band! And let it be of profit to the disillusioned, |
| Consideré le présent cas! | whom Fortune has cast down! |
| Si soit aux deceilz valable, |  |
| Que Fortune a flati à cas! |  |
| IX |  |
| Et note[z] comment esbahir | And note how, when someone finds himself quite unjustly |
| Ne se doit nul pour infortune, | attacked and hated on all sides, there is no need for such |
| Se voiant à grant tort haïr, | a person to feel dismayed by misfortune. See how Fortune, |
| Et courir sus par voix commune! | Who bas harmed many a one, is so inconstant, for God, |
| Voie[z] comment tousjours n’est une | Who opposes all wrong deeds, raises up those in whom |
| Fortune, qui a nuit à maint! | hope dwells. |
| Car Dieu, qui aux tors faiz repune, |  |
| Ceulx relieve en qui espoir maint. |  |
| X |  |
| Qui vit doncques chose avenir | Did anyone, then, see anything quite so extraordinary |
| Plus hors de toute opinion | come to pass (something that is well Worth noting and |
| (Qui à noter et souvenir | remembering in every region), namely, that France (about |
| Fait bien en toute région), | whom it was said she had been cast down) should see |
| Que France (de qui mention | her fortunes change, by divine command, from evil to |
| On faisoit que jus ert ruée) | such great good, |
| Soit, par divine mission, |  |
| Du mal en si grant bien muée, |  |
| XI |  |
| Par tel miracle voirement | as the result, indeed, of such a miracle that, if the matter |
| Que, se la chose n’yert notoire | were not so well-known and crystal-clear in every aspect, |
| Et évident quoy et comment, | nobody would ever believe it? It is a fact well Worth |
| Il n’est homs qui le peiist croire? | remembering that God should nevertheless have wished |
| Chose est bien digne de mémoire | (and this is the truth!) to bestow such great blessings |
| Que Dieu, par une vierge tendre, | on France, through a young virgin. |
| Ait adès voulu (chose est voire!) |  |
| Sur France si grant grace estendre. |  |
| XII |  |
| 0 quel honneur à la couronne | And what honour for the French crown, this proof of |
| De France par divine preuve! | divine intervention! For all the blessings which God |
| Car par les graces qu’Il lui donne | bestows upon it demonstrate how much He favours it and |
| Il appert comment Il l’apreuve, | that He finds more faith in the Royal House than anywhere |
| Et que plus foy qu’autre part treuve | else; as far as it is concerned, I read (and there is nothing |
| En l’estat royal, dont je lix | new in this) that the Lilies of France never erred in |
| Qu’oncques (ce n’est pas chose neuve!) | matters of faith. |
| En foy n’errerent fleurs de lix. |  |
| XIII |  |
| Et tu, Charles, roy des Francois, | And you Charles, King of France, seventh of that noble |
| VIIe d’icellui hault nom, | name, Who have been involved in such a great war before |
| Qui si grant guerre as eue aincois | things turned out at all well for you, now, thanks be to |
| Que bien t’en prensist se peu non: | God, see your honour exalted by the Maid Who has laid |
| Mais, Dieu grace, or voiz ton renon | low your enemies beneath your standard (and this is new!) |
| Hault eslevé par la Pucelle, |  |
| Qui a soubzmis soubz ton penon |  |
| Tes ennemis (chose est nouvelle!) |  |
| XIV |  |
| En peu de temps; que l’on cuidoit | in a short time; for it was believed quite impossible |
| Que ce feust com chose impossible | that you should ever recover your country which you |
| Que ton pays, qui se perdoit, | were on the point of losing. Now it is manifestly yours |
| Reusses jamais. Or est visible- | for, no matter who may have done you harm, you have |
| Ment tien, [puis que] qui que nuisible | recovered it! And all this has been brought about by |
| T’ait esté, tu l’as recouvré! | the intelligence of the Maid who, God be thanked, has |
| C’est par la Pucelle sensible, | played her part in this matter! |
| Dieu mercy, qui y a ouvré! |  |
| XV |  |
| Si croy fermement que tel grace | And I firmly believe that God would never have bestowed |
| Ne te seroit de Dieu donnée, | such grace upon you if it were not ordained by Him that |
| Se à toy, en temps et espace, | you should, in the course of time, accomplish and bring |
| Il n’estoit de Lui ordonnée | to completion some great and solemn task; I believe |
| Quelque grant chose solempnée | too that He has destined you to be the author of very |
| A terminer et mettre à chief, | great deeds. |
| Et qu’Il t’ait donné destinée |  |
| D’estre de tresgrans faiz le chief. |  |
| XVI |  |
| Car ung roy de France doit estre | For there will be a King of France called Charles, son |
| Charles, filz de Charles, nommé, | of Charles, who will be supreme ruler over all Kings. |
| Qui sur tous rois sera grant maistre. | Prophecies have given him the name of ‘The Flying |
| Propheciez l’ont surnommé | Stag’, and many a deed will be accomplished by this |
| “Le Cerf Volant,” et consomé | conqueror (God bas called him to this task) and in the |
| Sera par cellui conquereur | end he will be emperor. |
| Maint fait (Dieu l’a à ce somé), |  |
| Et en fin doit estre empereur. |  |
| XVII |  |
| Tout ce est le prouffit de t’ame. | All this is to the profit of your soul. I pray to God that |
| Je prie à Dieu que cellui soies, | you may be the person I have described, and that He |
| Et qu’Il te doint, sans le gref d’ame, | grant you long life, to nobody’s harm, so that you may |
| Tant vivre qu’encoures tu voyes | yet see your children grown up, I pray too that all joy |
| Tes enfans grans, et toutes joyes | come to France because of you and them! But, as you |
| Par toy et eulz soient en France! | serve God always, may war never cause havoc there |
| Mais en servant Dieu toutesvoies, | again (or by emending face to face[s]: ‘May you never |
| Ne guerre [plus] n’y face oultrance! | wage war to the death there again!’) |
| XVIII |  |
| Et j’ay espoir que bon seras, | I hope that you will be good and upright, and a lover of |
| Droiturier et amant justice, | justice and that you will surpass all others, provided |
| Et [tres] tous autres passeras, | your deeds are not tarnished by pride, that you will |
| Mais qu’orgueil ton fait ne honnisse; | be gentle and well-disposed towards your people, that |
| A ton pueple doulz et propice, | you will always love God who elected you as His servant |
| Et crairignant Dieu, qui t’a esleu | (and you have a first manifestation of this), on condition |
| Pour son servant (si com prémisse | that you do your duty. |
| En as), mais que faces ton deu. |  |
| XIX |  |
| Et comment pourras-tu jamais | And how will you ever be able to thank God enough, |
| Dieu mercier à souffisance, | serve and fear Him in all your deeds (for He has led |
| Servir, doubter en tous tes fais, | you from such great adversity to peace and raised up |
| Qui de si grant contrariance | the whole of France from such ruin) when His most |
| T’a mis à paix, et toute France | holy providence made you worthy of such signal honour? |
| Relevée de tel ruyne, |  |
| Quant sa tressainte providence |  |
| T’a fait de si grant honneur digne? |  |
| XX |  |
| Tu en soyes loué, hault Dieu! | May You be praised for this, great God! It is our bounden |
| A Toy gracier tous tenuz | duty to thank You who decreed time and place for these |
| Sommes, qui donné temps et lieu | blessings to come about. With hands clasped, both |
| As, où ces biens sont avenus. | great and small, we all thank You, Heavenly Lord, who |
| [A] jointes mains, grans et menus, | have guided us through the great tempest into peace |
| Graces Te rendons, Dieu céleste, |  |
| Par qui nous sommes parvenus |  |
| A paix, et hors de grant tempeste! |  |
| XXI |  |
| Et toy, Pucelle beneurée, | And you, blessed Maid, are you to be forgotten, given |
| Y dois-tu estre obliée, | that God honoured you so much that you untied the |
| Puis que Dieu t’a tant honnorée | rope which held France so tightly bound? Could one |
| Que as la corde desliée | ever praise you enough for having bestowed peace on |
| Qui tenoit France estroit liée? | this land humiliated by war? |
| Te pourroit-on assez louer |  |
| Quant ceste terre, humiliée |  |
| Par guerre, as fait de paix douer? |  |
| XXII |  |
| Tu, Jehanne, de bonne heure née, | Blessed be He who created you, Joan, who were born |
| Benoist soit cil qui te créa! | at a propitious hour! Maiden sent from God, into whom |
| Pucelle de Dieu ordonnée, | the Holy Spirit poured His great grace, in whom [Le. |
| En qui le Saint Esprit réa | the Holy Spirit] there was and is an abundance of noble |
| Sa grant grace, en qui ot et a | gifts, never did Providence refuse you any request. |
| Toute largesse de hault don, | Who can ever begin to repay you? |
| N’onc requeste ne te véa. |  |
| Qui te rendra assez guerdon? |  |
| XXIII |  |
| ue puet-il d’autre estre dit plus | And what more can be said of any other person or of |
| Ne des grans faiz des temps passez? | the great deeds of the past? Moses, upon whom God |
| Moÿses, en qui Dieu afflus | in His bounty bestowed many a blessing and virtue, |
| Mist graces et vertuz assez, | miraculously and indefatigably led God’s people out |
| Il tira, sans estre lassez, | of Egypt. In the same way, blessed Maid, you have |
| Le pueple de Dieu hors d’Egipte | led us out of evil! |
| Par miracle. Ainsi repassez |  |
| Nous as de mal, Pucelle eslite! |  |
| XXIV |  |
| Considerée ta personne, | When we take your person into account, you who are a |
| Qui es une jeune pucelle, | young maiden, to whom God gives the strength and |
| A qui Dieu force et povoir donne | power to be the champion who casts the rebels down |
| D’estre le champion et celle | and feeds France with the sweet, nourishing milk of |
| Qui donne à France la mamelle | peace, here indeed is something quite extraordinary! |
| De paix et doulce norriture, |  |
| Et ruer jus la gent rebelle, |  |
| Véez bien chose oultre nature! |  |
| XXV |  |
| Car, se Dieu fist par Josué | For if God performed such a great number of miracles |
| Des miracles à si grant somme, | through Joshua who conquered many a place and cast |
| Conquérant lieux, et jus rué | down many an enemy, he, Joshua, was a strong and |
| Y furent maint, il estoit homme | powerful man. But, after ail, a woman – a simple |
| Fort et puissant. Mais, toute somme, | shepherdess – braver than any man ever was in Rome! |
| Une femme — simple bergiere – | As far as God is concerned, this was easily accomplished. |
| Plus preux qu’onc homs ne fut à Romme! |  |
| Quant à Dieu, c’est chose legiere. |  |
| XXVI |  |
| Mais quant à nous, oncques parler | But as for us, we never heard tell of such an extraord- |
| N’oÿsmes de si grant merveille, | inary marvel, for the prowess of ail the great men of |
| Car tous les preux au long aler | the past cannot be compared to this woman’s whose |
| Qui ont esté; ne s’appareille | concern it is to cast out our enemies. This is God’s |
| Leur prouesse à ceste qui veille | doing: it is He who guides her and who has given her |
| A bouter hors noz ennemis. | a heart greater than that of any man. |
| Mais ce fait Dieu, qui la conseille, |  |
| En qui cuer plus que d’omme a mis. |  |
| XXVII |  |
| De Gedeon on fait grant compte, | Much is made of Gideon, who was a simple workman, |
| Qui simple laboureur estoit, | and it was God, so the story tells, who made him fight; |
| Et Dieu le fist, ce dit le conte, | nobody could stand firm before him and he conquered |
| Combatre, ne nul n’arrestoit | everything. But whatever guidance God gave [him], |
| Contre lui, et tout conquestoit. | it is clear that He never performed so striking a miracle |
| Mais onc miracle si appert | as He does for this woman. |
| Ne fist, quoy qu’Il ammonestoit, |  |
| Com pour ceste fait, il appert. |  |
| XXVIII |  |
| Hester, Judith et Delbora, | I have heard of Esther, Judith and Deborah, who were |
| Qui furent dames de grant pris, | women of great worth, through whom God delivered |
| Par lesqueles Dieu restora | His people from oppression, and I have heard of many |
| Son pueple, qui fort estoit pris, | other worthy women as well, champions every one, |
| Et d’autres plusers ay apris | through them He performed many miracles, but He has |
| Qui furent preuses, n’y ot celle, | accomplished more through this Maid. |
| Mains miracles en a pourpris. |  |
| Plus a fait par ceste Pucelle. |  |
| XXIX |  |
| Par miracle fut envoiée | She was miraculously sent by divine command and |
| Et divine amonition, | conducted by the angel of the Lord to the King, in |
| De l’ange de Dieu convoiée | order to help him. Her achievement is no illusion for |
| Au roy, pour sa provision. | she was carefully put to the test in council (in short, |
| Son fait n’est pas illusion, | a thing is proved by its effect) |
| Car bien a esté esprouvée |  |
| Par conseil (en conclusion, |  |
| A l’effect la chose est prouvée), |  |
| XXX |  |
| Et bien esté examinée | and well examined, before people were prepared to |
| A, ains que l’on l’ait voulu croire, | believe her; before it became common knowledge that |
| Devant clers et sages menée | God had sent her to the King, she was brought before |
| Pour ensercher se chose voire | clerks and wise men so that they could find out if she |
| Disoit, ainçois qu’il fust notoire | was telling the truth. But it was found in history |
| Que Dieu l’eust vers le roy tramise. | records that she was destined to accomplish her mission; |
| Mais on a trouvé en histoire |  |
| Qu’à ce faire elle estoit commise; |  |
| XXXI |  |
| Car Merlin et Sebile et Bede, | for more than 500 years ago, Merlin, the Sibyl and Bede |
| Plus de Vc ans a la virent | foresaw her coming, entered her in their writings as |
| En esperit, et pour remede | someone who would put an end to France’s troubles, |
| En France en leurs escripz la mirent, | made prophecies about her, saying that she would carry |
| Et leur[s] prophecies en firent, | the banner in the French wars and describing all that |
| Disans qu’el pourteroit baniere | she would achieve. |
| Es guerres françoises, et dirent |  |
| De son fait toute la maniere. |  |
| XXXII |  |
| Et sa belle vie, par foy, | And, in truth, the beauty of her life proves that she |
| Monstre qu’elle est de Dieu en grace; | has been blessed with God’s grace – and for that reason |
| Par quoy on adjouste plus foy | her actions are more readily accepted as genuine. For |
| A son fait. Car, quoy qu’elle face, | whatever she does, she always has her eyes fixed on |
| Tousjours a Dieu devant la face, | God, to whom she prays and whom she invokes and |
| Qu’elle appelle, sert et deprie | serves in word and deed; nowhere does her devotion |
| En fait, en dit; ne va en place | ever falter. |
| Où sa devotion detrie. |  |
| XXXIII |  |
| O comment lors bien y paru | Oh, how clear this was at the siege of Orléans where |
| Quant le siege ert devant Orliens, | her power was first made manifest! It is my belief |
| Où premier sa force apparu! | that no miracle was ever more evident, for God so came |
| Onc miracle, si com je tiens, | to the help of His people that our enemies were unable |
| Ne fut plus cler, car Dieu aux siens | to help each other any more than would dead dogs. |
| Aida telement, qu’ennemis | It was there that they were captured and put to death. |
| Ne s’aiderent ne que mors chiens. |  |
| Là furent prins et à mort mis. |  |
| XXXIV |  |
| Hee! quel honneur au femenin | Oh! What honour for the female sex! It is perfectly |
| Sexe! Que Dieu l’ayme il appert, | obvious that God has special regard for it when all |
| Quant tout ce grant pueple chenin, | these wretched people who destroyed the whole King |
| Par qui tout le regne ert desert, | dom – now recovered and made safe by a woman, some |
| Par femme est sours et recouvert, | thing that 5000 men could not have done – and the |
| Ce que Cm hommes [fait] n’eussent, | traitors [have been] exterminated. Before the event |
| Et les traictres mis à desert! | they would scarcely have believed this possible. |
| A peine devant ne le creussent. |  |
| XXXV |  |
| Une fillete de XVI ans | A little girl of sixteen (isn’t this something quite super |
| (N’est-ce pas chose fors nature?), | natural?) who does not even notice the weight of the |
| A qui armes ne sont pesans, | arms she bears – indeed her whole upbringing seems |
| Ains semble que sa norriture | to have prepared her for this, so strong and resolute |
| Y soit, tant y est fort et dure! | is she! And her enemies go fleeing before her, not |
| Et devant elle vont fuyant | one of them can stand up to her. She does all this in |
| Les ennemis, ne nul n’y dure. | full view of everyone, |
| Elle fait ce, mains yeulx voiant, |  |
| XXXVI |  |
| Et d’eulx va France descombrant, | and drives her enemies out of France, recapturing |
| En recouvrant chasteaulx et villes. | castles and towns. Never did anyone see greater |
| Jamais force ne fu si grant, | strength, even in hundreds or thousands of men! And |
| Soient ou à cens ou à miles! | she is the supreme captain of our brave and able men. |
| Et de noz gens preux et abiles | Neither Hector nor Achilles had such strength! This |
| Elle est principal chevetaine. | is God’s doing: it is He who leads her. |
| Tel force n’ot Hector n’Achilles! |  |
| Mais tout ce fait Dieu, qui la menne. |  |
| XXXVII |  |
| Et vous, gens d’armes esprouvez, | And you trusty men-at-arms who carry out the task |
| Qui faites l’execution, | and prove yourselves to be good and loyal, one must |
| Et bons et loyaulx vous prouvez, | certainly make mention of you (you will be praised in |
| Bien faire on en doit mention | every nation!) and not fail to speak of you and your |
| (Louez en toute nation | valour in preference to everything else, |
| Vous en serez!), et sans faillance |  |
| Parler sur toute election |  |
| De vous, et de vostre vaillance, |  |
| XXXVIII |  |
| Qui sanc, corps et vie exposez | you who, in pain and suffering, expose life and limb |
| Pour le droit, en peine si dure, | in defence of what is right and dare to risk confronting |
| Et contre tous perilz osez | every danger. Be constant, for this, I promise, will |
| Vous aler mettre à l’avanture. | win you glory and praise in heaven. For whoever fights |
| Soiés constans, car je vous jure | for justice wins a place in Paradise – this I do venture |
| Qu’en aurés gloire ou ciel et los! | to say. |
| Car qui se combat pour droiture |  |
| Paradis gaingne, dire l’os. |  |
| XXXIX |  |
| Si rabaissez, Anglois, voz cornes | And so, you English, draw in your horns for you will |
| Car jamais n’aurez beau gibier! | never capture any good game! Don’t attempt any foolish |
| En France ne menez voz sornes! | enterprise in France! You have been check-mated. |
| Matez estes en l’eschiquier. | A short time ago, when you looked so fierce, you had no |
| Vous ne [le] pensiez pas l’autrier, | inkling that this would be so; but you were not yet |
| Où tant vous monstriez perilleux; | treading the path upon which God casts down the proud. |
| Mais n’estiez encour ou santier, |  |
| Où Dieu abat les orguilleux. |  |
| XL |  |
| Ja cuidiés France avoir gaingnée, | You thought you had already conquered France and that |
| Et qu’elle vous deust demourer. | she must remain yours. Things have turned out other- |
| Autrement va, faulse mesgnié[e]! | wise, you treacherous lot! Go and beat your drums |
| Vous irés ailleurs tabourer, | elsewhere, unless you want to taste death, like your |
| Se ne voulez assavourer | companions, whom wolves may well devour, for their |
| La mort, comme voz compaignons, | bodies lie dead amidst the furrows! |
| Que loups pevent bien devourer, |  |
| Car mors gisent par les sillons! |  |
| XLI |  |
| Et sachez que par elle Anglois | And know that she will cast down the English for good, |
| Seront mis jus sans relever, | for this is God’s will: He hears the prayer of the good |
| Car Dieu le veult, qui oit les voiz | whom they wanted to harm! The blood of those who are |
| Des bons qu’ilz ont voulu grever! | dead and have no hope of being brought back to life |
| Le sanc des occis sans lever | again cries out against them. God will tolerate this |
| Crie contre eulz. Dieu ne veult plus | no longer – He has decided, rather, to condemn them |
| Le souffrir, ains les reprouver | as evil. |
| Comme mauvais, il est conclus. |  |
| XLII |  |
| En Christianté et l’Eglise | She will restore harmony in Christendom and the Church. |
| Sera par elle mis concorde. | She will destroy the unbelievers people talk about, and |
| Les mescreans dont on devise, | the heretics and their vile ways, for this is the substance |
| Et les herites de vie orde | of a prophecy that has been made. Nor will she have |
| Destruira, car ainsi l’acorde | mercy on any place which treats faith in God with |
| Prophecie, qui l’a predit, | disrespect. |
| Ne point n’aura misericorde |  |
| De lieu, qui la foy Dieu laidit. |  |
| XLIII |  |
| Des Sarradins fera essart, | She will destroy the Saracens, by conquering the Holy |
| En conquerant la Saintte Terre. | Land. She will lead Charles there, whom God preserve! |
| Là menra Charles, que Dieu gard! | Before he dies he will make such a journey. He is the |
| Ains qu’il muire, fera tel erre. | one who is to conquer it. It is there that she is to |
| Cilz est cil qui la doit conquerre. | end her days and that both of them are to win glory. |
| Là doit-elle finer sa vie, | It is there that the whole enterprise will be brought to |
| Et l’un et l’autre gloire acquerre. | completion. |
| Là sera la chose assovye. |  |
| XLIV |  |
| Donc desur tous les preux passez, | Therefore, in preference to all the brave men of times |
| Ceste doit porter la couronne, | past, this woman must wear the crown, for her deeds |
| Car ses faiz ja monstrent assez | show clearly enough already that God bestows more |

| Si est tout le mains qu’à faire ait | And yet destroying the English race is not her main |
| Que destruire l’Englecherie, | concern for her aspirations lie more elsewhere: it is |
| Car elle a ailleurs plus son hait | her concern to ensure the survival of the Faith. As |
| C’est que la Foy ne soit perie. | for the English, whether it be a matter for joy or sorrow, |
| Quant des Anglois, qui que s’en rie | they are done for. In days to come scorn will be heaped |
| Ou pleure, il en est sué. | on them. They have been cast down! |
| Le temps avenir moquerie |  |
| En sera fait. Jus sont rué! |  |
| XLVI |  |
| Et vous, rebelles rouppieux, | And all you base rebels who have joined them, you can |
| Qui à eulz vous estes adhers, | see now that it would have been better for you to have |
| Or voiez-vous qu’il vous fust mieulx | gone forwards rather than backwards as you did, thereby |
| D’estre alez droit que le revers, | becoming the serfs of the English. Beware that more |

| Gardez que plus ne vous aviengne | enough!), and remember what the outcome will be! |
| (Car trop avez esté souffers), |  |
| Et de la fin bien [vous] souviengne! |  |
| XLVII |  |
| N’appercevez-vous, gent avugle, | Oh, all you blind people, can’t you detect God’s hand |
| Que Dieu a icy la main mise? | in this? If you can’t, you are truly stupid for how else |
| Et qui ne le voit est bien bugle, | could the Maid who strikes you all down dead have |
| Car comment seroit en tel guise | been sent to us? – And you don’t have sufficient |
| Ceste Pucelle ça tramise | strength! Do you want to fight against God? |
| Qui tous mors vous fait jus abatre? |  |
| — Ne force [n’]avez qui souffise! |  |
| Voulez-vous contre Dieu combatre? |  |
| XLVIII |  |
| N’a el le roy mené au sacre, | Has she not led the King with her own hand to his |
| Que tousjours tenoit par la main? | coronation? No greater deed was performed at Acre; |
| Plus grant chose oncques devant Acre | for there were certainly plenty of opponents. But in |
| Ne fu faite; car pour certain | spite of everyone, he was most nobly received and |

| Mais, maulgré tous, à grant noblesse |  |
| Y fu receu, et tout à plain |  |
| Sacré, et là ouÿ la messe. |  |

| Atresgrant triumphe et puissance | It was exactly on the 17th day of July 1429 that Charles |
| Fu Charles couronné à Rains, | was, without any doubt, safely crowned at Rheims, |
| L’an mil CCCC, sans doubtance, | amidst great triumph and splendour and surrounded by |
| [Et XXIX, tout] sauf et sains, | many men-at-arms and barons; and he stayed there for |
| Ou gens d’armes et barons mains, | approximately five days, |
| Droit ou XVIIe jour |  |
| De juillet. [Pou plus ou pou mains’] |  |
| Par là fu V jours à sejour, |  |

| Avecques lui la Pucellette. | with the little Maid. As he returns through his country, |
| En retournant par son païs, | neither city nor castle nor small town can hold out |
| Cité ne chastel ne villete | against them. Whether be be loved or hated, whether |
| Ne remaint. Amez ou haÿs | they be dismayed or reassured, the inhabitants surrender. |
| Qu’il soit, ou soient esbaïs | Few are attacked, so fearful are they of his power. |
| Ou asseurez, les habitans |  |
| Se rendent. Pou sont envahis, |  |
| Tant sont sa puissance doubtans! |  |
| LI |  |
| Voir est qu’aucuns de leur folie | It is true that some, in their folly, think they can resist, |
| Cuident resister, mais peu vault, | but this serves little purpose, for, in the end, whoever |
| Car au derrain, qui contralie, | does offer opposition must pay God for his mistake. |
| A Dieu compere le deffault. | It is quite pointless. Whether they want to or not, they |
| C’est pour neant. Rendre leur fault, | must surrender. No matter how strong the resistance |
| Vueillent ou non. N’y a si forte | offered, it collapses beneath the Maid’s assault, |
| Résistance qui à l’assault |  |
| De la Pucelle ne soit morte, |  |
| LII |  |
| Quoy qu’on ait fait grant assemblée, | even though huge forces were gathered together, in |
| Cuidant son retour contredire | order to launch a surprise attack and bar his return; |
| Et lui courir sur par emblée; | but there is no need for a doctor’s attentions now, for |
| Mais plus n’y fault confort de mire, | all his opponents have been captured and killed, one |
| Car tous mors et pris tire à tire | by one, and dispatched, so I’ve been told, to Heaven |
| Y ont esté les contrediz, | or Hell. |
| Et envoyez, com j’oÿ dire, |  |
| En Enfer ou en Paradis. |  |
| LIII |  |
| Ne sçay se Paris se tendra | I don’t know if Paris will hold out (for they have not |
| (Car encoures n’y sont-ilz mie), | reached there yet) or if the Maid will delay [or if it will |
| Ne se la Pucelle attendra, | resist the Maid]. But if it decides to see her as an |
| Mais s’il en fait son ennemie, | enemy, I fear that she will subject it to a fierce attack, |
| Je me doubt que dure escremie | as she bas done elsewhere. If they offer resistance for |
| Lui rende, si qu’ailleurs a fait. | an hour, or even half an hour, it’s my belief that things |
| S’ilz resistent heure ne demie, | will go badly for them, |
| Mal ira, je croy, de son fait, |  |
| LIV |  |
| Car ens entrera, qui qu’en groingne! | for [the King] will enter Paris, no matter who may |
| — La Pucelle lui a promis. | grumble about it! – The Maid has given her word that |
| Paris, tu cuides que Bourgoingne | he will. Paris, do you think Burgundy will prevent |
| Defende qu’il ne soit ens mis? | him from entering? By no means, for he does not see |
| Non fera, car ses ennemis | himself as an enemy. Nobody has the power to prevent |
| Point ne se fait. Nul n’a puissance | him, and you will be overcome, you and your presumption! |
| Qui l’en gardast, et tu soubmis |  |
| Seras, et ton oultrecuidance! |  |
| LV |  |
| O Paris tresmal conseillié! | Oh Paris, how could you be so ill-advised? Foolish |
| Folz habitans sans confiance! | inhabitants, you are lacking in trust! Do you prefer to |
| Ayme[s]-tu mieulz estre essillié | be laid waste, Paris, rather than make peace with your |
| Qu’à ton prince faire accordance? | prince? If you are not careful your great opposition |
| Certes, ta grant contrariance | will destroy you. It would bc far better for you if you |
| Te destruira, se ne t’avises! | were to humbly beg for mercy. You are quite miscalculating! |
| Trop mieulx te feust par suppliance |  |
| Requerir mercy. Mal y vises! |  |
| LVI |  |
| J’entens des mauvais, car des bons | It is the evil inhabitants I’m referring to, for there are |
| Y a maint, je n’en fais pas doubte, | many good people there, I have no doubt about that; |
| Mais parler n’osent, j’en respons, | but, take my word for it, these good people, who are |
| A qui moult il desplaist sans doubte | no doubt much displeased to see their prince rejected |
| Que leur prince ainsi on deboute. | in this way, do not dare speak out. They will not merit |
| Si n’auront pas ceulx deservie | the punishment which will fall upon Paris and cost |
| La punition où se boute | many a person his life. |
| Paris, où maint perdront la vie. |  |
| LVII |  |
| Et vous, toutes villes rebelles, | And as for you, all you rebel towns, all of you who |
| Et gens qui avez regnié | have renounced your lord, all of you men and women who |
| Vostre seigneur, et ceulx et celles | have transferred your allegiance to another, may every |
| Qui pour autre l’avez nié, | thing now be peacefully settled, with you beseeching |
| Or soit après aplaniè | his pardon! For if force is used against you, the gift |
| Par doulceur, requerant pardon! | [i.e.of forgiveness] will come too late [i.e. not at all, |
| Car se vous este[s] manié | never]. |
| A force, à tart vendrez au don. |  |
| LVIII |  |
| Et qu’i[l] ne soit occision | And so as to avoid killing and wounding anyone [the |
| Faite, retarde tant qu’il puet, | King] delays for as long as he can, for the spilling of |
| Ne sur char d’omme incision, | blood grieves him. But, in the end, if someone does |
| Car de sang espandre se deult. | not want to hand over, with good grace, what is rightly |
| Mais, au fort, qui rendre ne veult | his, he is perfectly justified if he does recover it by |
| Par bel et doulceur ce qu’est sien, | force and bloodshed. |
| Se par force en effusion |  |
| De sang le recouvre, il fait bien. |  |
| LIX |  |
| Helas! Il est si debonnaire | Alas! He is so magnanimous that he wishes to pardon |
| Qu’à chascun il veult pardonner! | each and everyone. And it is the Maid, the faithful |
| Et la Pucelle lui fait faire, | servant of God, who makes him do this. Now as loyal |
| Qui ensuit Dieu. Or ordonner | Frenchmen submit your hearts and yourselves to him! |
| Vueillez voz cueurs et vous donner | And when you hear him speak, you will not be reproached |
| Comme loyaulx François à lui! | by anyone. |
| Et quant on l’orra sermonner |  |
| N’en serés reprins de nulluy. |  |
| LX |  |
| Si pry Dieu qu’Il mecte en courage | And I pray to God that He will prevail upon you to act |
| A vous tous qu’ainsy le faciez, | in this way, so that the cruel storm of these wars may |
| Afin que le cruel orage | be erased from memory and that you may live your lives |
| De ces guerres soit effaciez, | in peace, always loyal to your supreme ruler, so that |
| Et que vostre vie passiez | you may never offend him and that he may be a good |
| En paix, soubz vostre chief greigneur, | overlord to you. Amen. |
| Si que jamais ne l’offensiez |  |
| Et que vers vous soit bon seigneur. |  |
| Amen |  |
